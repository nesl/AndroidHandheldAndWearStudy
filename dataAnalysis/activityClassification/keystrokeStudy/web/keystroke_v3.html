		"Most of us are lucky if we have even one great passion in our lives. Dave Goldberg",
		"had many more; his wife Sheryl Sandberg, his children, his friends and colleagues,",
		"music, poker, and the Minnesota Vikings.",
		"On Dave's birthday last fall, a group of friends joined him at his home to watch the",
		"Vikings play the Packers. Dave did something that caught me off guard. At the time,",
		"it seemed small. But now it speaks profoundly to one of the many ways that Dave was",
		"larger than life.",
		"The game got off to an ugly start. In the first 10 minutes, the Vikings were down",
		"14-0. A typical fan would scream at the coach, start hurling objects at the TV, or",
		"give up on the game. But Dave stuck by his team. By halftime, the Vikings were losing",
		"28-0. Dave didn't budge; he kept rooting for them. In the third quarter, they were",
		"down 42-0. By this point, I wasn't even watching the game. I was watching Dave in",
		"awe -- because every time the Packers scored, he cheered louder for the Vikings. The",
		"further behind his team fell, the more he stood up for them. Even after losing 42-10,",
		"Dave still loved his team.",
		"That's who Dave Goldberg was. When your chips were down, he doubled down. As Sheryl",
		"expressed it Tuesday in the single most beautiful speech I've ever heard, 'Dave was",
		"my rock.'",
	],[
		"Dave was the CEO of SurveyMonkey, and he hosted me to speak there a year ago. When",
		"he gave the introduction, I was so embarrassed by his kind words that I could hardly",
		"speak. I knew I didn't deserve his praise, but I wanted to earn a fraction of it.",
		"Among the hundreds of talks I gave that year, it was the most extraordinary audience",
		"I had. Just as Dave did with everyone he met, the SurveyMonkey team instantly made",
		"me feel accepted. They listened more intently, and laughed more loudly, than any group",
		"I had addressed. I was so astonished by their generosity and curiosity that I hung",
		"around afterward, hounding various employees to find out how they had created such",
		"a positive culture. Over and over, I heard the same thing; the secret ingredient was",
		"Dave.",
		"It was clear that Dave made a concerted effort to recruit people who cared about others,",
		"who loved to learn and have fun. But his team stressed something far more meaningful;",
		"Dave built that culture by example. His helpfulness, inquisitiveness and joy were",
		"contagious. His employees wanted to be like him.",
		"Great leaders build things that outlast them. Inspired by Dave's example, SurveyMonkey",
		"will continue to thrive. This week, the teams worked late to finish projects that",
		"mattered most to Dave, and used the hashtag 3makedaveproud.",
		"When leaders are admired, it's usually for what they do for the company. But Dave's",
		"team admired him for what he did for them. Dave saw and brought out the best in others.",
		"His goodness moved us even more than his greatness.",
		"I've spent a dozen years studying generosity, and there is no one who embodied it",
		"like Dave. Touching tributes have extolled him as a loving father and husband, the",
		"heart and soul of Silicon Valley, a lifelong advocate for women, best friend to many,",
		"a compassionate leader, and a gracious and generous connector who was bright, kind,",
		"humble, and universally admired and liked.",
	],[
		"Like his wife, her parents, and his own parents, Dave lived his life in service of",
		"others. He was an advocate for SurveyMonkey Contribute, which has donated over 45",
		"million to charity in exchange for people taking surveys. He was a dedicated benefactor",
		"of a wide range of important causes, particularly in education and healthcare. But",
		"he rarely spoke about his philanthropic work.",
		"'David Goldberg embodied the definition of a real leader -- someone who was always",
		"looking for ways to empower others,' President Obama wrote. 'He was generous and kind",
		"with everybody, and cared less about the limelight than making sure that the people",
		"he worked with and loved succeeded in whatever they did.'",
		"Dave was quiet about his contributions because he was modest, but also because he",
		"genuinely took more joy in the success of others than his own. His startup was streaming",
		"music online before most people had even heard of the internet, but he didn't talk",
		"about that. He grew SurveyMonkey from 12 employees to 500, building it into a billion-dollar",
		"company, but he didn't talk about that. As he wisely noted last year, his best advice",
		"for leaders was to 'Stop talking. Ask and listen.'",
		"A little over a month ago, I saw Dave for the last time. As always, there was no handshake;",
		"he greeted me with a teddy bear hug. When I asked him what was new in his life, he",
		"immediately said the highlight was the Lean In Together campaign. He beamed with pride",
		"at the prospect of fathers becoming more involved with their children, husbands becoming",
		"50-50 partners, and men becoming more supportive of women at work.",
	],[
		"Dave was Sheryl's biggest fan, and he cheered for her even more passionately than",
		"the Vikings. When she was writing Lean In, she didn't want to put her picture on the",
		"cover or share her personal stories. She wanted the book to be about progress for",
		"women, not about her. Dave knew the movement needed a champion. It needed a human",
		"face and voice. He encouraged her to lean in.",
		"Queen Elizabeth II said that grief is the price we pay for love, and for Dave, the",
		"grief is immeasurable. My heart is aching for Sheryl and their children. It is also",
		"hurting deeply for the world.",
		"I don't believe this happened for a reason, but it has given us all a reason to be",
		"more present parents, more loving spouses, more supportive friends, and more caring",
		"leaders. The overwhelming sentiment from everyone who knew Dave is that he inspired",
		"us to be better human beings. And he had that effect on us throughout his life, long",
		"before we lost him. 'Things will never be the same,' Sheryl said, 'but the world is",
		"better for the years my beloved husband lived.'",
		"There is little that can bring solace in this time, but there is one memory of Dave",
		"that I will cherish forever. In the spirit of candor, Sheryl is not the world's biggest",
		"football fan. But on his last birthday, when Dave walked in the door, she and the",
		"kids were decked out in Vikings jerseys.",
		"Dave broke out in the biggest grin imaginable, and I have never seen a person happier.",
		"He loved his family with all his heart, and he knew they loved him the same way.",
